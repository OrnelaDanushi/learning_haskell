-- An IO action will be performed when we give it a name of main and then run the program

-- to glue together several IO action into one:
main = do
    putStrLn "Hello, what's your name?"
    name <- getLine -- it reads a line from the input and stores it into a variable called name
    putStrLn ("Hey "++ name ++", you rock!")

-- :t main
-- main :: IO ()
-- the type is IO () because that's the type of last IO action inside
-- Because of that, main always has a type signature of main :: IO something
-- where something is some concrete type
-- So, by convention, we don't usually specify a type declaration for main

-- :t getLine
-- getLine :: IO String
-- it is an IO action that contains a result type of String
-- it will wait for the user to input something at the terminal and then that something
-- will be represented as a String
-- So, it performs the IO action and then bind its result value to name
-- Since, it has a type of IO String, name will have a type of String.
-- With the <- construct, we get data out of an IO action
-- getLine is impure because its result value is not guaranteed to be the same when performed twice
-- for this, it is tainted with the IO type constructor and we can only get that data out in IO code
-- and because IO code is tainted too, any computation that depends on tainted IO data will have
-- tainted result.
-- With 'tainted' is meant in not a way that we can never use the result contained in an IO action
-- ever again in pure code.
-- No, we temporarily un-taint the data inside an IO action when we bind it to a name. 
-- so, when we do name <- getLine, name is just a normal String

-- Notice that we didn't bind the last putStrLn to anything.
-- That's because in a do block, the last action cannot be bound to a name, like the first two were.
-- The do block, automatically, extracts the value from the last action and binds it to its own result.
-- Except for the last line, every line in a do block that doesn't bind can also be written with a bind.
-- So putStrLn "Blah" can be written as _ <- putStrLn "Blah" 
-- but that's useless, so we leave out the <- for IO actions that don't contain
-- an important result, like putStrLn 'something'

-- Beginners sometimes think that doing: name = getLine
-- will read from the input and then bind the value of that to name
-- well, it won't, it gives the getLine IO action a different name called, name

-- by binding it to a name with <-

-- IO actions will only be performed when they are given a name of main
-- or when they're inside a bigger IO action that we composed with a do block.
-- We can also use a do block to glue together a few IO actions and then
-- we can use that IO action in another do block and so on.
-- Either way, they'll be performed only if they eventually fall into main.
